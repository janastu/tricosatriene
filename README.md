# Credits

This project is a hacked up re-write of [MangoServer](https://github.com/azaroth42/MangoServer) which was written using the Bottle python micro-framework. CORS preflight requests were not working using bottle. Therefore this has been re-written to use flask and flask-cors plugin.

# Name
